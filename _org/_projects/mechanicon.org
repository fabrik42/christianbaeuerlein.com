The [[https://mechanicon.io][Mechanicon]] is Europeâ€™s biggest meetup/conference for people interested in mechanical keyboards.

We started out with about 60 people in 2016, grew to 150 people in 2017, 250 in 2018, and 2023 we were about 380 attendees with visitors from all over Europe!

At its core, it is still a [[https://www.meetup.com/mechanical-keyboard-meetup-rhein-main][user group of keyboard enthusiasts]].
