[[https://ffwdmejs.org/][ffwdme.js]] is a JavaScript toolkit that aims to bring interactive GPS driving directions to the mobile browser. It was first built and used on the iPhone 3G.

It powered different novel navigation projects, for example instantnavi ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJIx3l_ByYk][Video]]), a platform where users could create their own customized navigation systems via web UI.



ffwdme.js is available as [[https://github.com/ffwdme/ffwdme.js][open source on GitHub]].
