<p>
A <a href="https://github.com/fabrik42/acts_as_api">Ruby gem</a> that simplifies the process of creating JSON or XML responses for Rails applications. The gem allows Rails models to define different templates of their API representations, which is especially useful when you want to have different JSON/XML outputs for the same model in different situations.

<p>
Among others, it powers the API of <a href="https://diasporafoundation.org">Diaspora</a>, one of the first decentralized social networks and <a href="https://github.com/phoet/on_ruby">OnRuby</a>, a whitelabel site used by many German Ruby communities.
